Morse code in a web page.  
Click the start button and type letters at the page to hear them in Morse.
Scroll down to find the controls for words/minute timing, pitch, envelope shaping, key input alternatives, and keyer options.
Best used with an iambic paddle interfaced through a MIDI interface, the page listens for MIDI NoteOn and NoteOff to trigger the iambic keyer.
The page treats even notes as one paddle and odd notes as the other paddle, and NoteOn with velocity 0 as a NoteOff.
But in a pinch you can use Alt and Ctrl keys, or bring up paddles on a touch screen.
